        Excuses sound best, to the person who’s making them up. But, life has no place for excuses. 
        Life only has only a little time. All though it will continue to go on, you cannot hold on. 
        And think that every day is promised to you. A promise to live your dream! No one knows what
         that dream you have. No one cares how disappointing it might have been as you’ve been working 
         toward that dream. But that dream that you’re holding in your mind, is possible. When you run 
         towards your dream, life has a special kind of meaning. A meaning that can give birth to a great
          person like, late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam did. He did recognize himself at a very early age. He 
          became one of the best scientists and presidents India has ever had.
        Popularly known as the missile man, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is one of the most loved personalities.
        Not only kids but youth loved this missile man due to his playful, generous, giving, caring, 
         and loving nature. The legend has left-back, for us, some really great teachings. Let’s see
         some of them.
